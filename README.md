    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>The land registration system is an essential component of any government system that keeps track of land ownership records. In India, the conventional Land Registration method is a lengthy process that necessitates the verification of additional documents, causing registration to be delayed. Furthermore, this process necessitates a large number of intermediaries, increasing the number of fraudulent situations such as middlemen taking bribes to complete the process. It's also possible to make mistakes while processing land records. Corruption and disagreements are caused by a number of flaws and vulnerabilities in the current system. It is a time-consuming operation to manage transactions for land registration. It is highly insecure and vulnerable to forging land records, verification issues, middlemen, and other issues. These issues can be solved by using digital signatures for land transactionÂ management.</p>
    <h3>Code Running Instructions</h3>
    <p>The code calls on the land 1 and land 2 documents by their paths in the local device and must be updated before execution.</p>
    <p>Every time the execution is terminated the system reverts to its original self and all updates are discarded.</p>
